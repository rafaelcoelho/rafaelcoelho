## âœ¨ Hi there! I'm Rafael Coelho âœ¨

First of all I am Software Developer and my main mantra is **Talk is cheap. Show me the code. (Linus Torvalds)**

Software advocate (architect, tester, analyst, agilist and so on) basically a DEVELOPER! He is passionate about software and system development applying best practices and **productive methodologies ever** (fully based on innovation from daily basis) because **in the end of the day** the only thing that really matters is the **software working in production**.

You can find me on Twitter at [@rscoelho](https://twitter.com/rsacoelho) and on Linkedin at [www.linkedin.com/in/rscoelho](www.linkedin.com/in/rscoelho)
