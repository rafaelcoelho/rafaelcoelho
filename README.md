## âœ¨ Hi there! I am Rafael Coelho âœ¨

First of all I am Software Developer and my main mantra is **Talk is cheap. Show me the code. (Torvalds Linus)**

My main cause is for Software Advocating (architect, tester, analyst, agilist and so on) basically extending for a solid DEVELOPER! After family my passion is **motorcycles** and everything related to software/system development applying best practices and always **productive methodologies** (fully based on innovation from daily basis) because **in the end of the day** the only thing that really matters is the **software working in production**.

You can find me on Twitter at [@rsacoelho](https://twitter.com/rsacoelho) and on Linkedin at [www.linkedin.com/in/rscoelho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rscoelho/)

Please be free to be in touch!ðŸ¤˜
