## âœ¨ Hi there! I'm Rafael Coelho âœ¨

First of all he is Software Developer and his main mantra is **Talk is cheap. Show me the code. (Torvalds Linus)**

The main cause of him is Software Advocating (architect, tester, analyst, agilist and so on) basically extending for a solid DEVELOPER! After his family he is passionate by **motorcycle** and about software/system development applying best practices and always **productive methodologies** (fully based on innovation from daily basis) because **in the end of the day** the only thing that really matters is the **software working in production**.

You can find me on Twitter at [@rsacoelho](https://twitter.com/rsacoelho) and on Linkedin at [www.linkedin.com/in/rscoelho](www.linkedin.com/in/rscoelho)
